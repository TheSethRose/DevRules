# Project Configuration

## Project Information
- Project Name: UseAgents.io
- Description: A comprehensive directory and learning platform for AI agent technologies, LLMs.txt implementations, and MCP integrations
- Repository: https://github.com/TheSethRose/useagents.io
- Current Version: 1.0.0
- License: MIT

## Team Information
- Maintainer: Seth Rose
- Team Members: N/A (solo project)

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Database: Prisma ORM with SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod)
- Authentication: NextAuth.js for user authentication, admin roles
- Deployment: Vercel
- Testing: N/A

## Project Structure
- `/app`: Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `/components`: Reusable React components
  - `/ui`: Base UI components from shadcn/ui
  - `/layout`: Layout components (header, footer)
  - `/directory`: Components for the various directories
  - `/auth`: Authentication components
  - `/cards`: Card components for different views
- `/lib`: Utility functions and shared code
- `/public`: Static assets
- `/prisma`: Database schema and migrations
- `/docs`: Project documentation

## Data Models
- DirectoryEntry: Approved entries in the directory
  - Fields: id, name, category, description, website, github, documentation, tags, compatibility, status, createdAt, updatedAt, submittedBy
- LlmsTxtEntry: Implementations of the LLMs.txt standard
  - Fields: id, website, llmsTxt, llmsTxtTokens, llmsFullTxt, llmsFullTxtTokens, category, notes, status
- McpEntry: MCP server implementations
  - Fields: id, name, website, github, description, features, compatibility, status
- User: User accounts for authentication
  - Fields: id, name, email, emailVerified, image, role

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Status flow: Submissions start as "pending", can be changed to "approved" or "rejected" by admins
- Directory entries must have valid information and links
- Only approved entries are shown in the public directory
- Admin users have access to the admin dashboard for managing submissions

## Goals
- Create a comprehensive platform for AI agent technologies
- Provide educational resources for implementing LLMs.txt and MCP
- Build a directory of tools, models, and implementations
- Foster a community of AI developers and practitioners
- Maintain data quality through admin approval process
