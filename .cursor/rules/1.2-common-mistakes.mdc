# Common Mistakes

This file documents common mistakes that AI tends to make repeatedly. When populated with actual mistake patterns, the AI should actively check against these patterns to avoid repeating known issues.

## Format: Use [TAGS] for structure; keep entries concise
Optional tags: [CONTEXT], [EXAMPLE], [REFERENCE], [FRAMEWORK], [VERSION], [LANGUAGE]

## Common Mistake Patterns

### MISTAKE: Outdated Syntax in recent versions
[PATTERN] AI Tends to use the data it was trained on.
[SOLUTION] Use live web browsing, verify latest docs for correct imports.

### MISTAKE: Missing Lucide Icon Imports
[PATTERN] Icons from lucide-react are imported but not all used icons are included in the import list.
[EXAMPLE] ChevronLeft and ChevronRight used in components but missing from imports.
[FRAMEWORK] Next.js, React
[SOLUTION] Always verify all Lucide icons used in the component are included in the imports at the top of the file.
[REFERENCE] Common error: "Cannot find name 'IconName'".

### MISTAKE: Running development server unnecessarily
[PATTERN] Automatically running `npm run dev` after making changes to verify them.
[SOLUTION] Do not run the development server as the user will handle this themselves. Focus only on implementing the requested changes.
[CONTEXT] The user prefers to control when to run the development server, so avoid running it automatically even after significant changes.
